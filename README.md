RandomStuffMod
==============

This is a open source mod that adds random stuff to minecraft. Feel free to download and look at my code. You can edit it and submit it back to me if you think that you have made an improvement. Also, feel free to also submit new Items, Textures, Mobs or other things for me t put in Random Stuff, I will add something in the mod that says that you did contribute to the mod :D.
